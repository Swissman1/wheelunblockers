            <h2>If you are currently in the situation</h2>
            <p >
                Contact the towing company, pay them, ideally with credit card. For now get yourself out of the situation, and dispute it later. Document the following: <ul>
                    <li>The sign stating the parking regulations and fines</li>
                    <li>The operator's vehicle(s) for the following: company name, phone number and address.</li>
                    <li>Ask the operator for identification showing the following: their name, their company name, company address, phone number.</li>
                    <li>Get a recording, if possible. NC is a one party consent state. </li>
                </ul>
                If you are feeling threatened, or unsafe, call 911. They will not assist you to deal with the unfair boot, but they will ensure heads remain level.
                They are required to provide you a receipt by law. Do not antagonize the operator. Remain the better person. Once you have exited the scene, then follow the rest of the guide.

            <h2>If you have paid with cash:</h2>
           <p>
 North Carolina in Charlotte views towing and booting disputes as civil matters.For legal purposes more than likely you will be pursuing the property owner, not the parking enforcement operator. 

Get your receipt, search the <a href="https://www.sosnc.gov/online_services/search/by_title/_Annual_Report">NC Secretary of State LLC</a>, and <a href="https://www.sosnc.gov/online_services/search/by_title/_Annual_Report">assumed name search</a> for the business name listed on the receipt/sign. 
Note if they do not turn up they are a ghost operation, which assists your case. You are legally required to register in one or both of those databases in order to do business in the state of NC.
Go to the <a href="https://polaris3g.mecklenburgcountync.gov/"></a>Mecklenburg Polaris website</a>, locate the address at which you were booted, and click on it, click on the property report, and locate the property owner field in the upper right. 
If they are a non-human entity, repeat the same process as with the operator in the <a href="https://www.sosnc.gov/online_services/search/by_title/_Annual_Report">NC LLC search</a>.
Review your photos of the signage, or return to the scene to get signage (they cannot boot you while you are present at your vehicle).
In order to be considered a fair parking enforcement sign, it must meet the following: 
<ul><li>Have a narrowly defined fee schedule.
</li><li>A reasonable card fee(no more than 5% generally)</li>
<li>Must accept cash and two different credit cards.</li>
</ul>
Review your photos of the operator, they must have their company's name, phone number and address on the vehicle.
<br>

Note that if they have charged a reasonable fee, and it breaks 0-1 of the above rules, More than likely this is a legitimate infraction and you do not have standing. However if they are a predatory / illegitimate operation, below are your legal recourses:
<ul>
    <li>
Contact the property owner formally demanding restitution. State the reasons above that the operation was in violation of, in a calm But firm wording. The owner can be located by the <a href="https://polaris3g.mecklenburgcountync.gov/">Polaris property lookup</a>.
Note this is likely to be a generic LLC and you may have to send them a letter, preferably via certified mail to ensure legal notice of delivery.
You can use this template, inserting and modifying as needed.
    </li>
    <li>
<a href="https://ncdoj.gov/file-a-complaint/consumer-complaint/"></a>File a complaint with the NC Dept of Justice. Consumer protection</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

After pursuing one or both of those avenues, particularly the property owner letter, You may choose to file in small claims court. 
This comes with a approximately $100 cost, but upon victory, due to it being unfair business practice, you are likely entitled by default to triple damages(NCGS), 
and recovery of the filing fee. Neither party can hire a lawyer to represent them there. The threat alone is likely to get them to settle. 
These people thrive in darkness, hoping you won't follow through.
