            <h3>Important Note</h3>
            <p>Even if an operator is violating code(ones with a red border), CMPD usually treats this as a <strong>civil matter</strong>. You will likely have to pay to get your car back. <strong>Document everything</strong> and use our <a href="help.html">Legal Kit</a> to file for a refund in small claims court.</p>
            <p>Parking lots are private property, but enforcement must happen within the framework of <strong>Charlotte City Code</strong> and <strong>NC State Law</strong>.</p>
            <p>This guide and project does not condone intentional non-compliance with parking rules. None of the above should encourage one to knowingly park where they should not.</p>

                <h3>Mandatory Identification(Sec. 6-564(a))</h3>
                <p>Upon request, the operator <strong>must</strong> provide company photo ID that includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Company Name</li>
                    <li>Company Phone Number</li>

                <h3>Vehicle Marking(Sec. 6-564(b))</h3>
                <p>Operators must use vehicles clearly marked with the company name, phone number, and address. <strong>Rogue operators often omit the address to avoid service of process.</strong></p>

                <h3>Acceptable payment requirements for booters (Sec. 6-564(c))</h3>
                A booting service must accept cash and at least two major credit and debit cards. 
                The statute does not explicitly bar high(20%) fees, but is likely to be weighed as a unfair bus. practice by a small claims magistrate.

                 <h2>2. Fair Pricing(NCGS 75-1.1)</h2>
                 <p>There is currently no hard cap on the books for what is considered reasonable fees in NC, after a 2011 CLT ordinance capping fees was overturned in 2016 by NC Supreme Court (King v. Town of Chapel Hill). 
                     Legitimate operators will charge no more than $150 for a boot with a fixed/narrow range, and 200 for a tow. 
                     Below board operators will often quote a wide range for the booting, often starting at $150, and going as high as $2000, which allows them to charge what they feel like.
                     Unreasonable fees alone are unlikely to allow you to win a case on the grounds of unfair/deceptive business practices, 
                     but it is always worth a shot to make at the minimum a NCDOJ complaint to help raise awareness to a pattern.</p>

                    <span class="tag">Scenario A</span>
                    <h3>No Signage</h3>
                    <p>Short-notice towing is illegal. If no signs are posted, a vehicle must generally be abandoned for 24+ hours or impeding traffic flow before action is taken.
                        The business must manually contact the tow company and fill out a tow request.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="scenario-card">
                    <span class="tag">Scenario B</span>
                    <h3>The 24x24 Sign</h3>
                    <p>Standard in South End/NoDa, this is where the predatory operators thrive. Signs <strong>must</strong> be 24"x24" and list the operator's name, address, phone, and specific fees. If any info is missing, they are in violation.</p>
                    <p>Some operators have been known to post in the lot with spotter cars in these lots. Upon owners leaving the property line, they pounce and boot. 
                        This practice is currently legal, but the operator performing the boot and collecting/removing the boot must still abide by CLT 6-564(a-b).
                    </p>

                    <h3>City Parking</h3>
                    <p>These spots are denoted by smaller "No Parking", "2 HR Limit", or parkMobile, with "Call (704)336-7400" which is Charlotte 311. 
                        Enforcement is via tickets by City of charlotte employees. Towing is performed by SP+, but only in cases of multiple unpaid tickets, or impeding traffic flow.</p>

                    <span class="tag">Scenario D</span>
                    <h3>Small non-standard Customer Only parking signs</h3>
                    <p>Requires a business employee to manually call and sign for the tow. An operator lurking in these lots and towing without a signature is a violation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="scenario-card">
                    <span class="tag">Scenario E</span>
                    <h3> Automated Plate Reader Surveillance Lot</h3>
                    <p>These are seen in larger lots and decks, and can be identified by the cameras pointing into each entrance, with signs requesting you scan a QR to register your visit. 
                        Legal standing is currently ambigous, as Metropolis, a major operator of these lots recently settled with the state of TN $8.75m for deceptive business practices.
                        They are unlikely to tow on sight, but will issue "fines" that if unpaid can have you booted/towed on sight from other company operated lots.
